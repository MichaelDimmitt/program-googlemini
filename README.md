## program-googlemini
looking to persist info through communication and storage on a private server.

as a developer I want to be able to do more with my google assistant. 
<br>much more! but I have been running into a lot of trouble.

finally my goal is to allow google to remember specific things.
1) answers to specific questions

Bonus) open up websites and read from those websites as an answer to the question
<br>or perform an action like find my iphone.

this may be posible through the application itself of by having the mini communicate with another one of my applications running on a server. 

not very optimistic resolving this one.
